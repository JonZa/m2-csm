# TODO: Remove GitHub Workflows

## Problem Analysis
User wants to completely remove the GitHub workflow from the repository. Need to identify and delete any GitHub Actions configuration files that may exist.

## Plan

### Todo Items
- [x] **Find GitHub workflow files** - Look for .github/workflows directory and any workflow files
- [x] **Remove workflow files** - Delete any GitHub Actions workflow configuration files found
- [x] **Verify no other GitHub automation** - Check for any other GitHub-related automation files
- [x] **Create new branch** - Create a branch for this change
- [x] **Commit and push** - Add descriptive commit message for removing workflows
- [x] **Create pull request** - Submit PR to remove workflows
